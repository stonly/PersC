  <h1>PersC Chrome Extension</h1>
  This extension simply lets you keep track of how far along you are on in the web page you're currently viewing. <br><br>The percentage number indicates the percentage of the page that you've completed.
  <br><br>
  The next release will include "Jump To" so you can indicate what percantage you want to jump to in the page and the extension will take you there.
